                                            <p>As we’ve worked with hundreds of
                                                engineering teams, we’ve found
                                                repeatable methods to improve
                                                engineering practices, remove
                                                roadblocks, and enhance the
                                                developer experience.</p>

                                                Objective data balanced with
                                                qualitative feedback. This balance
                                                is particularly crucial in the
                                                retrospective meeting, so we’ll
                                                guide you on how to use this data
                                                with a retrospective lens.

                                                As cycle time has become an
                                                important indicator of team health
                                                and development success, we’ve

                                                cycle time was partly due to factors outside their control.

                                                The next step is to look at trends across your team to see a bigger picture of how the overall team is doing.
                                                You can do this by using the Retrospective report.

                                                around your processes. If your team takes a long time to review tickets or provide feedback, why is that? Are
                                                they overwhelmed with other requests? Do they feel pressured to prioritize their own projects? Median queue time
                                                will help you start these conversations.

                                                refine overall feedback processes. Sometimes it’s as simple as recommitting the team to jump onto code reviews,
                                                but it can also help you make the case for additional team members or support from other teams.
